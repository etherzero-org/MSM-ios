## The easy and secure etherzero wallet

Bread is the best way to get started with bitcoin. Our simple, streamlined design is easy for beginners, yet powerful enough for experienced users.

### Completely decentralized

Unlike other iOS bitcoin wallets, **MSM** is a standalone bitcoin client. It connects directly to the bitcoin network using [SPV](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Thin_Client_Security#Header-Only_Clients) mode, and doesn't rely on servers that can be hacked or disabled. Even if Bread the company disappears, the app will continue to function, allowing users to access their money at any time.

### Cutting-edge security

**MSM** utilizes AES hardware encryption, app sandboxing, and the latest iOS security features to protect users from malware, browser security holes, and even physical theft. Private keys are stored only in the secure enclave of the user's phone, inaccessible to anyone other than the user.


### Localization

**MSM** is available in the following languages:

- Chinese (Simplified and traditional)
- Danish
- Dutch
- English
- French
- German
- Italian
- Japanese
- Korean
- Portuguese
- Russian
- Spanish
- Swedish

We manage all translations with:

### WARNING:

***Installation on jailbroken devices is strongly discouraged.***

Any jailbreak app can grant itself access to every other app's keychain data. This means it can access your wallet and steal your bitcoin by self-signing as described [here](http://www.saurik.com/id/8) and including `<key>application-identifier</key><string>*</string>` in its .entitlements file.

**MSM** is open source and available under the terms of the MIT license.
